### Discipline Agents

**Sisyphus** (`claude-opus-4-6` / **`kimi-k2.5`** / **`glm-5`** ) is your main orchestrator. He plans, delegates to specialists, and drives tasks to completion with aggressive parallel execution. He does not stop halfway.

**Hephaestus** (`gpt-5.3-codex`) is your autonomous deep worker. Give him a goal, not a recipe. He explores the codebase, researches patterns, and executes end-to-end without hand-holding. *The Legitimate Craftsman.*

**Prometheus** (`claude-opus-4-6` / **`kimi-k2.5`** / **`glm-5`** ) is your strategic planner. Interview mode: it questions, identifies scope, and builds a detailed plan before a single line of code is touched.

### Agent Orchestration

When Sisyphus delegates to a subagent, it doesn't pick a model. It picks a **category**. The category maps automatically to the right model:

| Category             | What it's for                      |
| :------------------- | :--------------------------------- |
| `visual-engineering` | Frontend, UI/UX, design            |
| `deep`               | Autonomous research + execution    |
| `quick`              | Single-file changes, typos         |
| `ultrabrain`         | Hard logic, architecture decisions |

### World-Class Tools for Your Agents

- **LSP**: `lsp_rename`, `lsp_goto_definition`, `lsp_find_references`, `lsp_diagnostics`. IDE precision for every agent
- **AST-Grep**: Pattern-aware code search and rewriting across 25 languages
- **Tmux**: Full interactive terminal. REPLs, debuggers, TUI apps. Your agent stays in session
- **MCP**: Web search, official docs, GitHub code search. All baked in

### Codes Better. Hash-Anchored Edits

> *"None of these tools give the model a stable, verifiable identifier for the lines it wants to change... They all rely on the model reproducing content it already saw. When it can't - and it often can't - the user blames the model."*
>
> <br/>- [Can Bölük, The Harness Problem](https://blog.can.ac/2026/02/12/the-harness-problem/)

Inspired by [oh-my-pi](https://github.com/can1357/oh-my-pi), we implemented **Hashline**. Every line the agent reads comes back tagged with a content hash:

```
11#VK| function hello() {
22#XJ|   return "world";
33#MB| }
```

The agent edits by referencing those tags. If the file changed since the last read, the hash won't match and the edit is rejected before corruption. No whitespace reproduction. No stale-line errors.

### Deep Initialization. `/init-deep`

Run `/init-deep`. It generates hierarchical `AGENTS.md` files:

```
project/
├── AGENTS.md              ← project-wide context
├── src/
│   ├── AGENTS.md          ← src-specific context
│   └── components/
│       └── AGENTS.md      ← component-specific context
```

Agents auto-read relevant context. Zero manual management.

### Planning. Prometheus

`/start-work` calls Prometheus. **Interviews you like a real engineer**, identifies scope and ambiguities, builds a verified plan before touching code. Agent knows what it's building before it starts.

### Skills

Skills aren't just prompts. Each brings:

- Domain-tuned system instructions
- Embedded MCP servers, on-demand
- Scoped permissions. Agents stay in bounds

Built-ins: `playwright` (browser automation), `git-master` (atomic commits, rebase surgery), `frontend-ui-ux` (design-first UI).

Add your own: `.opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md` or `~/.config/opencode/skills/*/SKILL.md`.

## Uninstallation

To remove oh-my-opencode:

1. **Remove the plugin from your OpenCode config**

   Edit `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `opencode.jsonc`) and remove `"oh-my-opencode"` from the `plugin` array:

   ```bash
   # Using jq
   jq '.plugin = [.plugin[] | select(. != "oh-my-opencode")]' \
       ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json > /tmp/oc.json && \
       mv /tmp/oc.json ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
   ```

2. **Remove configuration files (optional)**

   ```bash
   # Remove user config
   rm -f ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.json ~/.config/opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc

   # Remove project config (if exists)
   rm -f .opencode/oh-my-opencode.json .opencode/oh-my-opencode.jsonc
   ```

3. **Verify removal**

   ```bash
   opencode --version
   # Plugin should no longer be loaded
   ```
